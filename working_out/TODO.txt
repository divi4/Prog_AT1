Stop and return to it later
There is a way to do a inverse operation

Create the first half of t
Then feed a copy of FHT to xor function
xor gets its length for the loop
then it selects each character one by one
to do the xor operation on, adding the
result to a new string
Once loop done, return string to thue-morse
to add to the other half of t to create a
new t
Repeating this n times
